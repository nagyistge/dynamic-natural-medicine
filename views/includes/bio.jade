    p Dr. Read was born in Cambodia, where traditional natural medicine plays a pivotal
      | role in daily living. While raised in the Pacific Northwest, naturopathic medical
      | school was a fitting step for Dr. Read, as it allowed her to embrace her Cambodian
      | roots. She earned a Bachelor of Science in psychology at Ithaca College in Ithaca,
      | New York, and went on to work at Dana Farber, a top rated cancer institute in
      | Boston. After spending several years in Boston, she returned to Seattle to attend
      | Bastyr University.

    p While completing her doctorate in Naturopathic Medicine and Masters of Science in
      | acupuncture, Dr. Read discovered a love for treating children, women, and couples
      | wishing to conceive. Based on these interests, she sought out additional training in
      | pediatrics, womenâ€™s health, and fertility. As a holistic practitioner and mother, she
      | believes in starting each life off on the right foot. This involves optimizing the health
      | of parents before conception and treating babies using a holistic approach beginning
      | at birth. Dr. Read considers laughter a cornerstone to health, and incorporates
      | humor and laughter into her practice and into her relationships with patients.

    p When not seeing patients, Dr. Read enjoys hiking, traveling, cooking, watching
      | movies, and spending time with her husband, daughter, and two dogs. She is
      | a member of the American Association of Naturopathic Physicians, Pediatric
      | Association of Naturopathic Physicians, and the Washington Association of
      | Naturopathic Physicians. She is currently accepting new patients and invites you to
      | come explore a healthier, happier life for yourself and your family.
